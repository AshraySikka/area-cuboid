# Area-cuboid

This Python script calculates the **surface area** of a cuboid based on user-provided dimensions (length, width, and height).

## 📐 Formula Used

The **total surface area** \( A \) of a cuboid is calculated using:

\[
A = 2 \times (lw + lh + wh)
\]

Where:
- \( l \) = length  
- \( w \) = width  
- \( h \) = height

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run the script using the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python area-cuboid.py
